Virtual DOM, Reconciliation, Diffing Algorithm, Keys and DOM

âœ” DOM (Document Object Model)
â—¼   It is the representation of HTML elements/nodes in tree format in the browser.

âœ”  Virtual DOM
â—¼   It is the representation of actual DOM in memory.
â—¼   It is nothing but a Javascript object.  
â—¼   It acts as middle layer between react components and actual DOM.
     â—½   React component  âž– Virtual DOM âž– Actual DOM 
â—¼   Virtual DOM is a old concept but React uses it effectively to make reconciliation process more powerful.

âœ”  Reconciliation â†” Diffing Algorithm â†” React Fiber
â—¼   These are the core of React ðŸš€
â—¼   Reconciliation is a process which uses "diffing algorithm" to compare two virtual DOMs (initial and updated) to find the difference between the HTML elements/nodes and updates the actual DOM using "only the updated nodes".
â—¼   Behind the scene it actually compares two Javascript objects {ðŸ‘´} - {ðŸ§‘}
â—¼   React Fiber : It is the new reconciliation algorithm in React, it was released in React 16.

âœ” Key property 
â—¼   Always provide a "unique value" to key whenever looping on any "list items". We usually use "map" method to loop over list items.
â—¼   Providing keys to list items will make reconciliation process more efficient to render the HTML elements/nodes on to DOM. 
â—¼   Reconciliation process will come to know easily what was there (old virtual dom)  and what has changed (new virtual dom) between the two renders and update the DOM elements quickly. 
â—¼   Try to get the unique values from the back-end data and avoid giving array index as key (suggested by React team). 
â—¼   Index will create issues if the sort operation performed on data (Index will be altered) and data will not displayed on the UI as expected.
â—¼   Keep this (index) as last option if there are no unique values available.

â—¼   Array Index < Unique ID (best practice) ðŸ‘ˆ
