# Projects

Congratulations for making it to this far. Now, you have a solid understanding of React. I believe we have covered most important features of React and your are ready to work on projects. What we have covered so far is the old version of React. Starting from Day 20, we will learn React Hooks. In the next three days you will work on projects only.

# Exercises

## Exercises: Level 1

Use the following two APIs, [all cats](https://api.thecatapi.com/v1/breeds) and [a single cat][https://api.thecatapi.com/v1/images/search?breed_id=abys]. In the single cat API, you can get url property which is the image of the cat.

```js
import React, { Component } from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";

[
  {
    breeds: [],
    categories: [{ id: 5, name: "boxes" }],
    id: "hn",
    url: "https://cdn2.thecatapi.com/images/hn.jpg",
    width: 1200,
    height: 1600,
  },
  {
    breeds: [],
    id: "182",
